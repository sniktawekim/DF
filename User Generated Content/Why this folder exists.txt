I use a folder like this to hold all my screenshots, maps exported from legends mode, backups of save files, and so on.  It makes it a lot easier to change versions when I can just copy a single folder into the new location, along with the save folder!

The script provided to copy files to a new version operates on a similar principle - everything in this folder is copied.  Hopefully it works for you too!
