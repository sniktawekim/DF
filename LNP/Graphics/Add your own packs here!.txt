Extract any graphics packs you want to be able to use into this folder.

Make sure it has its own folder, and is not in a folder within a folder. It should
LOOK LIKE: "Graphics\Mayday\[files]"
NOT LIKE:  "Graphics\Mayday\Mayday\[files]"

Once placed you can press the "Simplify Graphic Folders" button in the Graphics tab of the LNP GUI. This deletes any unnecessary files the pack may contain.
This is useful to save space or to re-pack to a friend.
