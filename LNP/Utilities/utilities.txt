[DorvenRealms.exe:Dorven Realms:Creates a Minecraft level from exported world maps (dfhack "exportlegends maps" in legends mode).]

[DwarfTherapist.exe:Dwarf Therapist:Makes managing your dwarves' jobs easy, and helps explore your fort's psychology.  Note that dfhack autolabor (arguably easier) must be disabled set jobs with Dwarf Therapist.]

[isoworld.exe:Isoworld:Makes an isometric world map from exported detailed maps.  It can also connect to DF to show a 'detailed view' of the current area, which is fantastic in Adventure Mode.]

[soundSense.exe:SoundSense:A Sound+Music engine for DF - it reads the gamelog, and plays appropriate sounds and seasonal music.]
