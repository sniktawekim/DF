A simple program to convert DF world maps into Minecraft maps.

To get the maps needed by the program, open a DF world in legends mode, and export detailed maps of Elevation, Elevation with water, and Biomes.

Most of the options should be self explanatory.

Currently, DorvenRealms saves the map as a creative world. If this is not what you want, then replace the generated world.dat with one from another save.
