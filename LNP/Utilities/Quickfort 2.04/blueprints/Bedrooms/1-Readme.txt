Name format is as follows:

number of rooms-median room area-Name-purpose.csv

Files without a named purpose have no alternate versions, and are presumed to be -dig.  

So, 30-25-Marklrar_Ribbon.csv has 30 rooms, with a median area of 25 tiles, and is a digging blueprint.  

All designs have an associated image file. 

Almost all designs have been received custom starting points (usually centered).

A few more housing designs can be found in the "Jurph's Fractal and Modular Expansion Pack" folder
