# QUICKFORT USER OPTIONS

# You can use Shift+Alt+R while QF is running to restart QF, which
# will reload options.txt.


#----------------------------
# Playback
#----------------------------

# Set this to 'macro' to use DF 0.31.x's macro ability (very fast).
# Set this to 'key' to send keystrokes to the DF game window (slower).
# The visualize command (Alt+V) always sends keystrokes.
# This can be persistently toggled using QF's Alt+K hotkey.

# The following keybinds are used to get Dwarf Fortress to do stuff.
# Syntax: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm

# Quickfort GUI options
#----------------------------

# Set this to 0 to disable the startup balloon traytip.

# Set to 0 to disable the mouse tooltip entirely.

# Manual material selection
#----------------------------

# menu looking for a memorized material before giving up

# Key-sending
#----------------------------

# The following options only apply when PlaybackMode = key,
# when using Alt+V 'visualize', and when using manual material

# Determines key-sending method, one of:
#   Send SendEvent SendInput SendPlay ControlSend
# Details: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
SendMode = Send

# Controls how long QF waits between sending keystrokes.
# Increase this value if things go too quickly for your computer
# when digging/building; decrease to build faster. Slower computers,
# larger resolutions and bigger DF maps may need a larger delay.
DelayMultiplier = 1

# How long to pause after building doors, picking from materials
# lists, etc. If QF seems to go off the rails in these
# circumstances, try increasing this value.
